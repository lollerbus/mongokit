Changing collections dynamically
===============================

Each `MongoDocument` must have a `db_host`, a `db_port`, a `db_name` and a `collection_name`.
These attributes are set when describing mongo documents. The connection, the db and the
collection are then automatically created and attached to the object.

But you might need to specify a different db or collection dynamically. For instance,
say you want to store a User in the database. You can't set the `db_name` and `collection_name`
because it will change for each user.

>>> class User(MongoDocument):
...     structure = {'login':unicode, 'screen_name':unicode}
...     # we can set `db_name` here...

Mongokit allows you to change these parameters on the fly. For this, you need to create
another collection with the helper `get_collection`.

>>> user_col = User.get_collection(db_name='namlook', collection_name='profile')

Now, we can query the database by passing our new collection :

>>> User.all({}, collection=col)

You can pass this value to the `MongoDocument.__init__` :

>>> user = User(db_name='namlook', collection_name='profile')
>>> user['login'] = 'namlook'
>>> user['screen_name'] = 'Namlook'

calling `user.save()` will save the object into the database 'namlook' in the collection 'profile'

Internal structure
==================

SchemaDocument
--------------

A `SchemaDocument` brings all the structure and the validation layer. It is designed to be
light and powerful with a simple api. This object is completely disconnected from the db and
can be used as stand-alone in another projects. Just copy the `schema_document.py` and the
`operators.py` files. This object is pretty useful if you want to bring the validation layers
of mongokit into another db. You'll need to implement all the database layers thought.

MongoDocument
-------------

A `MongoDocument` brings all mongodb related stuff to the SchemaDocument.
This object defines all methods to deal with a mongod server.


Little api changes
==================

There is a little api change with this new changeset :

 *  `MongoDocument._connection` and  `MongoDocument._collection` are removed and replaced by
   public one : `MongoDocument.connection` and `MongoDocument.collection`.
 * `MongoDocument.db` has appeared.
 * `_get_connection()` was removed.
 * `MongokitOperator` has been renamed to `SchemaOperator` for more consistency.
 * `belong_to` becomes `belongs_to`

Note that if you sticked to the tutorial and didn't use internal methods or
attributes, you don't need to change anything.
