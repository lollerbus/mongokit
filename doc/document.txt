Documents
=========

Documents are the basic building blocks of MongoKit. They define the schema
of each document and how that document should be accessed

Document Class
--------------
::

    from mongokit import Document, Connection

    class MyDocument(Document):
        structure = {
            ...
        }
        required_fields = [
            ...
        ]
        default_values = {
            ...
        }

You can read more about the `structure`_ attribute, and the ``required_fields`` and ``default_values``  `descriptors`_. They are the primary definition of a document. MongoKit also supports
`handling i18n`_, `indexes`_, and `migration`_.

    .. _`structure`: structure.html

    .. _`descriptors`: descriptors.html

    .. _`handling i18n`: i18n.html

    .. _`indexes`: indexes.html

    .. _`migration`: migration.html

Registering
-----------

Once a document has been defined, it must be registered with a Connection::

    connection = Connection()
    connection.register([MyDocument])

Optionally, the register method can be used as a decorator::

        @connection.register
        class MyDocument(Document):
            structure = {...}


Database and Collection
-----------------------

To use a Document, you must call it from a collection. In pymongo's syntax, you would use
``connection.<database>.<collection>`` to access the collection. Once you have
the collection, you can create a new document::

    >>> connection.database.collection.MyDocument()
    {... new Document's default values ...}

As a short cut, you can define the database and collection names in the
Document definition::

    @connection.register
    class MyDocument(Document):
        __collection__ = 'collection_name'
        __database__ = 'database_name'
        structure = {...}

Now, we can have access to our document directly from the connection::

    >>> connection.MyDocument()
    {... new Document's default values ...}

Note that if you want to specify the ``__database__``, you should also specify the
``__collection__`` attribute.

It is also possible to access the Document from the database:

    >>> connection.database.MyDocument() # this will use __collection__ as collection name

This matches the typical pattern of creating and passing around a ``db`` object:

    >>> connection = Connection()
    >>> db = connection[MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME]
    >>> db.MyDocument()

Changing Collection Dynamically
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You might need to specify a different db or collection dynamically. For instance,
say you want to store a User by database.

    >>> class User(Document):
    ...     structure = {'login':unicode, 'screen_name':unicode}

    >>> con.register([User])

Like pymongo, MongoKit allow you to change those parameters on the fly :

    >>> user_name = 'namlook'
    >>> user_collection = connection[user_name].profile #returns a reference to the database 'namlook' in the collection 'profile'.

Now, we can query the database by passing our new collection :

    >>> profiles = user_collection.User.find()

    >>> user = user_collection.User()
    >>> user['login'] = 'namlook@namlook.com'
    >>> user['screen_name'] = 'Namlook'

Calling ``user.save()`` will save the object into the database ``namlook``
in the collection ``profile``.

Dot Notation
------------

If you want to use the dot notation (ala json), you must set the
``use_dot_notation`` attribute to True::

    class TestDotNotation(Document):
        use_dot_notation = True

        structure = {
            'foo':{
                'bar': basestring
            }
        }

>>> connection.register([TestDotNotation])
>>> doc = connection.database.TestDotNotation()
>>> doc.foo.bar = 'blah'
>>> doc
{'foo': {'bar': 'blah'}}

Note that if an attribute is not in structure, the value will be added as attribute :

    >>> doc.arf = 3 # arf is not in structure
    >>> doc
    {'foo': {'bar': u'bla'}}

If you want to be warned when a value is set as attribute, you can set the `dot_notation_warning` attribute as True.

Polymorphism
------------

In the following example, we have two objects, A and B, which inherit from Root.
And we want to build an object C from A and B. Let's build Root, A and B
first::

    from mongokit import *
    class Root(Document):
        structure = {
            'root': int
        }
        required_fields = ['root']

    class A(Root):
        structure = {
            'a_field': basestring,
        }
        required_fields = ['a_field']


    class B(Root):
        structure = {
            'b_field': basestring,
        }


Polymorphisms just work as expected::

    class C(A,B):
        structure = {'c_field': float}

>>> c = C()
>>> c == {'b_field': None, 'root': None, 'c_field': None, 'a_field': None}
True
>>> C.required_fields
['root', 'a_field']
