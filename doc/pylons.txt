Pylons support
==============

You can very easily interface Mongokit with Pylons. This tutorial explains how to do this.
Note that there's a lot of ways to do the same thing. If you found another better solution,
please contact me, I'll update this tutorial.

Write all your models in ``model/``.  In the ``model/__init__.py``, import all the module
you want to register and then add them to a list called `register_models`.

Example of ``model/__init__.py``::

    from blog import Blog
    from blogpost import BlogPost

    register_models = [Blog, BlogPost]

Then go to the ``lib/app_globals.py`` and edit this file so it look like this::

    from pylons import config
    from <appname>.models import register_models
    from mongokit import *

    class Globals(object):

        """Globals acts as a container for objects available throughout the
        life of the application

        """

        def __init__(self):
            """One instance of Globals is created during application
            initialization and is available during requests via the
            'app_globals' variable

            """
            self.connection = Connection(
              host = config['db_host'],
              port = int(config['db_port']),
            )
            self.db = self.connection[config['db_name']]
            self.connection.register(register_models)


In this file, we create the connection (and optionally the db if we use one) and then
we register all our models.

Now, you can access the connection via the pylons.config :

    config['pylons.app_globals'].connection

A more convenient way is to add the connection to the BaseController so you can access
it just with ``self.connection``. The file ``lib/base.py`` has to look like this::

    from pylons.controllers import WSGIController
    from pylons import config
    import pylons

    class BaseController(WSGIController):

        connection = config['pylons.app_globals'].connection

        def __call__(self, environ, start_response):
            """Invoke the Controller"""
            # WSGIController.__call__ dispatches to the Controller method
            # the request is routed to. This routing information is
            # available in environ['pylons.routes_dict']
            return WSGIController.__call__(self, environ, start_response)
